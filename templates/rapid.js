    "description":`In Fall 2017 Project Rapid kicked off its first mission, Blue Dawn. In collaboration with space plasma physics researchers in UCLAâ€™s Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, this mission will explore the effectiveness of a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pump in microgravity. The experiment was selected by the <a href="https://www.asgsr.org/index.php/about/awards/2084-ken-souza-spaceflight-competition-award">Ken Souza Memorial Student Spaceflight Competition</a> to fly on a Blue Origin test flight of the New Shepard rocket. Compartmentalized into a 2U CubeSat form-factor, this mission will provide critical insight into the efficacy of a technology that may have applications in space life support systems.`,

        "description": "Pumps play a vital role in transporting fluids for waste management, thermal control systems, and life support systems. However, spacecraft currently rely on mechanical pumps, which contain physically degradable components and thus pose a threat to the longevity of life support systems. That's where our solution comes in: MHD pumps have the potential to be a great alternative since they have no moving parts; they may be more long-lasting and safer to use. If our experiment can demonstrate the operational ability of an MHD pump, it can be used for a number of space applications and will revolutionize fluid transport in space.",

        "title": "The Payload",
        "description": "An MHD pump operates according to the fundamental physical principles that act to transport charged particles in the presence of an electric and magnetic field. In electromagnetism the force acting on a charged particle is proportional to the surrounding electric and magnetic fields, and this force influences a particle to travel with a certain velocity perpendicular to both fields. Blue Dawn applies this principle to a conductive fluid by constructing a pump with strong magnets adjacent to a pair of electrodes between which fluid can flow.",
