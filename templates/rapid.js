Designed to be a high power spacecraft bus, we will be supporting the research efforts of the <a href="wirz.seas.ucla.edu/plasma">Plasma and Space Propulsion Lab at UCLA</a>. <br><br>This is by far the most challenging project we have ever taken on here at Bruin Space, so we are looking for the best of the best to make it happen. If you are interested in being a part of the first entirely student designed and built satellite, reach out to the Project Manager on slack. Project Rapid has a rolling application, and will accept new members as necessary. See <a href="${links.openings}">our openings page</a> for specific positions we are looking to fill.`,

In collaboration with space plasma physics researchers in UCLAâ€™s Department of Earth, Planetary, and Space Sciences, this mission will explore the effectiveness of a Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pump in microgravity. The experiment was selected by the <a href="https://www.asgsr.org/index.php/about/awards/2084-ken-souza-spaceflight-competition-award">Ken Souza Memorial Student Spaceflight Competition</a> to fly on a Blue Origin test flight of the New Shepard rocket. Compartmentalized into a 2U CubeSat form-factor, this mission will provide critical insight into the efficacy of a technology that may have applications in space life support systems.`
