									Project Overseer is a long term project to develop a reliable platform for scientific payload and technology demonstrations through the use of high altitude balloon launches. Our mission is to provide a cost efficient and easily accessible resource for UCLA researchers seeking to perform experiments or increase hardware TRLs. We want to provide students who have limited engineering experience with an opportunity to develop and enhance skills useful in increasingly complex projects.

									Overseer is designed as a broad multi-mission launch platform to support the launch and recovery of scientific instruments and incorporates many internal subsystems to make this dream a reality. While by no means a complete diagram, this picture gives a broad look at how its components fit within the bus and the internal volume of our missions in general through the lens of prototype designs.

										<h2>Overview</h2>
										<p>
											Building on the lessons learned last year with Aperture, we have embarked on a redesign of our system. The focus is now on modular design, as we aim to build a versatile platform capable of supporting multiple missions.
										</p>
									</div>
									<div id="mission2" class="scrollable-content__textbox" data-item="2">
										<h2>Electrical backbone</h2>
										<p>Our system would not function without our electrical backbone, visualized here by the Raspberry Pi 3B and the location of some AA battery holders. This configuration is designed to give Overseer a wealth of computational power and an acceptable level of battery power. However, given the modular design, it is simple to insert more battery packs for longer duration or higher power missions.</p>
									</div>
									<div id="mission3" class="scrollable-content__textbox" data-item="3">
										<h2>Multi-project modularity</h2>
										<p>While our project does not feature much internal storage space, its multi-mission module (currently configured to support a GoPro-like camera) can be quickly swapped in for another module should the need arise, allowing for easy swapping and fast turnaround between missions.</p>
